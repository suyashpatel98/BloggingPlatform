To see this project in action one needs to have mongodb and nodejs installed.

1) Download all the files
2)Then run <npm install> in the directory that has the package.json file as it lists all the dependencies.
3)Then cd into src and run <nodemon app.js> and open any browser and type <localhost:3000>.

This will get you started with the project. This project is basically to guide one to understand how to work with the express framework and mongodb. Front-end has not been looked at in great detail as that was not the intention of this project.

NOTE : When you register or login or browse any other page you need to keep mongodb running.
